# Computational Creativity

## Project Goal

The goal was to create a user interface for two unrelated systems. One system would create an image based on user input, the second would style that image to a particular genre & later during development I attempted to find a method to categorise said image so that it may be titled.

## Generated Images

### Notes
* There is a large data set not added to open_images_annotations_100 as the files are too big for GitHub to take. This may cause the program not to work on other computers.
