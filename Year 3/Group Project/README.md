## how to set up Django on your local machine
Disclaimer this was done in IntelliJ so may be some subtle differences

You will need to make sure you have the following installed:

* [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), this makes it easier to download the rest. 


* Django, Plotly-dash and plotly-dash-django can all be installed easily with a pip command:
  * [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/install/#installing-official-release)
  * Dash - pip install plotly==5.5.0
  * Plotly-dash-django -  you can do this by typing 'pip install django-plotly-dash' into the terminal

## running the server

* In a terminal, go to the StockWebApp directory and type 
'python manage.py runserver'
