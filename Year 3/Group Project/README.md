# Group Project

## Project Goal

The goal was to create a web based application capable of providing the user with a buy/hold/sell recommendation for a particular stock. The application needed to be able to provide a reason for its result (based on the different types of analysis).

## Further Work
* To improve the accuracy of recommendation I would increase the number of technical indicators allowing an intricate & full analysis for stocks to be taken and trained thus improving the competency of the recommendation.

* To address the narrow selection of stock choice I would investigate using genetic algorithms to control the values introduced in the neural network training. This would allow our application to self-evaluate against a fitness function and make any stock available for our users.
