Thirteen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg on average had expected about 263,000 vehicles for the quarter, though some had revised their numbers upward in the final days of December.\n\nThe record quarter underscores the \u201cgreen tidal wave taking hold\u201d for Tesla and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk heading into 2022, Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients. The strong results also point to robust demand in China and Tesla\u2019s skill at navigating the global semiconductor shortage, he said. The company\u2019s previous delivery record was 241,300, set in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThis is a trophy-case quarter for Tesla as the company blew away even bull-case expectations,\u201d Ives, who rates the shares as outperform and has a $1,400 price target, said in an email. He called it a \u201cjaw-dropper performance for Musk & Co. in the December quarter with massive tailwinds into 2022.\u201d\n\nCrypto trading suggests that Austin, Texas-based Tesla\u2019s shares will rise when Wall Street wakes up Monday. Tesla tokens climbed 2% to $1,093 as of 2:38 p.m. in New York on the FTX crypto exchange after the deliveries were announced Sunday.\n\nThe EV market leader\u2019s shares have soared on the back of expectations for continued growth, with the stock up almost 50% in 2021 and a market valuation exceeding $1 trillion -- one of only five publicly listed U.S.-based companies to achieve that status. The shares fell 1.3% on Dec. 31 to close at $1,056.78.\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk praised his crew for coming through, saying in a tweet that the numbers were the result of \u201cgreat work by Tesla team worldwide.\u201d\n\nQuarterly deliveries are one of the most closely watched indicators for Tesla. They underpin its financial results and are widely seen as a barometer of consumer demand for electric vehicles as a whole because the company has led the charge for battery-powered cars.\n\nRead more: Tesla cedes a bit of trillion-dollar value to end year\n\nTesla has said repeatedly it expects 50% annual increases in deliveries over a multi-year period. The seventh consecutive quarterly gain comes amid a global semiconductor slump that has crimped production at most other automakers and kept sales in check despite rising demand.\n\nMusk, who became the world\u2019s richest person last year, has described 2021 as a \u201csupply chain nightmare\u201d even as his company continued to grow deliveries each quarter. It has fared better than other automakers due in part to efforts by its engineers to rewrite software to adapt to whatever chips they could find for other purposes.\n\nTesla has said its delivery counts should be viewed as slightly conservative, and final numbers could vary by 0.5% or more.\n\nDeliveries and actual production don\u2019t necessarily match up one-for-one during any given quarter. Production was 305,840 for the fourth quarter and 930,422 for the year.\n\nThe company doesn\u2019t break out sales by geography, but the U.S. and China are its largest markets and the bulk of sales were of the Model 3 and Y. Tesla currently makes the Model S, X, 3 and Y at its factory in Fremont, California, and the Model 3 and Y at its plant in Shanghai. In 2022, Tesla will be adding production capacity with two new factories coming online in Austin and Berlin.\n\nMusk has promised to provide an update on Tesla\u2019s new product plans on the company\u2019s next earnings call.\n\n(Updates with analyst comment in third paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Really Happens When Workers Are Given a Flexible Hybrid Schedule?
